# Solutions for some exercises of "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" by a brainless idiot 🚀
I plan to upload my solutions for some of the exercises in "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (third edition)". 
I must state that, even though I do have some experience with programming, I considerably suck at it. So please, note that these are the solutions of a very dumb student trying to learn the language and how to write good shit. Please, consider any of my code as shit :)
Help and advices from more experienced programmers are always welcome.

Note: I am not using the header the book uses for no freaking reason 🍷🗿
