I plan to upload my solutions for some of the exercises (mostly drills) in "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (third edition)". I must state that, even though I do have some experience with programming, I am considerably suck at it. So please, note that these are the solutions of a very dumb student trying to learn the language and how to write good shit. Please, consider any of my code as shit.
